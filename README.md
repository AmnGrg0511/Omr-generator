## Overview
OMR Generator is a web app that simulates a full online test interface for timed quizzes. It focuses on creating a realistic exam experience with navigation, question palettes, and in-test tools.

## Why It Stands Out
- Exam-like UI with sectioned navigation and question palette
- Timed test flow with progress tracking
- Answer selection optimized for speed and clarity

## Key Capabilities (Planned)
- Timed quizzes with sectioned navigation
- Question palette with status indicators
- Review and mark-for-later flows
- Result summary and basic analytics

## Tech Stack
- Web app (frontend-focused)

## Developer Quickstart
Install dependencies, run the dev server, and use the preview flow to validate quiz navigation.

## Roadmap
- Build the full test runner interface
- Add question palette and review states
- Add results and summary views
